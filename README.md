## Disclaimer
I'm sorry if expected to find some p*rn here. This is a [kernel] for educational
reasons!

## How to run
There's a nix-flake so you just need to execute `nix develop` and have all dependencies installed!
Otherwise you'll need `just`, `make`, `libisoburn` and `qemu`.

Afterwards just execute `just run`.

## FAQ
### Why this name?
Well, because this is the dumbest name I could find. Imagine a discussion
between two people like this:

> A: Hey, I use Arch btw. which OS are you using?
>
> B: Oh nice, I use PornOS 24/7.
>
> A: Oh cool, never heard of i- wait a minute. ***What did you just say?***

## Other information
This is a kernel to learn how to write a kernel. It's ***not*** meant to be used
in production! I'm not responsible if you're running it on your real system and
some stuff might get broken!
